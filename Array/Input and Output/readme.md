This is a simple input output program where the user enters the values of the Array and the Array get's displayed again . I've used this 
example to show how classes and objects work . 

Line 4-9: 

          In classes and objects , it's preferable to declare variables with the private access specifier and member functions with the 
          public access specifier . I've declared all the member functions as void as none of them will return the values to the main
          function. Also note that classes do not have () in their header and when closing a class you should close it with a };

          In this program i have a Array A in which the user will input the values and two member functions INP and DIS , in which the
          user will input the array and the array will be displayed from respectively . 
          
          
Line 11-20:

          In this member function , the user enters the size of the array and the elements of the array .

Line 22-29:

          In this memeber function , the Array that the user enters is now displayed.
          
Line 31-37:

          I've created an object from the class ARR called A . Using the object , i'm calling the member functions as seen in Line 34-35.
